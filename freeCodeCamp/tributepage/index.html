            Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815-1852), born Augusta Ada Byron, was an English mathematician and writer.
            She is chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.
            Her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine.
